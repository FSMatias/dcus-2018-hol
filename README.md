Hands on Labs for DockerCon US 2018

[Docker for Beginners - Linux](/beginner-linux/)
You've been learning about Docker, here's a chance to get a hands on introduction to the key concepts of Docker. This lab will cover the basics of 
* Images
* Running containers
* Container isolation
* Orchestration

[Docker for Beginners - Windows](/beginner-win/)
You've been learning about Docker, here's a chance to get a hands on introduction to the key concepts of Docker. This lab will cover the basics of 
* Images
* Running containers
* Container isolation
* Orchestration

[Docker EE - an Introduction](/ee-intro/)
Docker Enterprise Edition (EE) is a Containers-as-a-Service platform that manages and secures diverse applications across disparate infrastructure, both on-premises and in the cloud. This workshop will introduce you to the basics of creating and deploying an app on Docker EE. 

[Docker Security](/security/)
The Docker Platform has built in a number of features that make it the most secure way to deploy containerized applications across disparate infrastructure. This lab will explore features such as Security Scanning, Role Based Access Control, Security Policies, and Docker Content Trust.

[Modernizing Traditional Java Applications](/mta-java/)
Moving an application to Docker doesn't mean you have to re-write your whole application. In this lab, you'll containerize an older, monolithic Java application without changing any code. And you'll see the benefit of running it on Docker. Then in a few simple steps you'll build additional services in separate containers, breaking features out of the monolith into separate containers, without rewriting the app. 

[Modernizing Traditional .NET Applications](/mta-dotnet/)
Moving an application to Docker doesn't mean you have to re-write your whole application. In this lab, you'll containerize an older, monolithic .NET application without changing any code. And you'll see the benefit of running it on Docker. Then in a few simple steps you'll build additional services in separate containers, breaking features out of the monolith into separate containers, without rewriting the app. 

[Docker EE with Kubernetes](/mta-workshop/)
Docker EE 2.0 (beta) is the first Containers-as-a-Service platform to offer production-level support for the integrated management and security of both Linux and Windows Server Containers. It is also the first platform to support both Docker Swarm and Kubernetes orchestration.

In this lab we'll use a Docker EE cluster comprised of Windows and Linux nodes. We'll deploy both a Java web app on Linux and a multi-service application that includes both Windows and Linux components using Docker Swarm. Then we'll take a look at securing and scaling the application. Finally, we will then deploy the app using Kubernetes.


[Continuous Delivery and Containerization](/cicd/) - Levering Docker and Jenkins 2 to simplify and standardize your pipeline
Jenkins' updated support for pipeline allows us to script our approach to continuous delivery in a way that we could not before. Additionally, it includes several steps specifically aimed at making it simple to create and use Docker containers to simplify and standardize the pipeline stages. Join us in this workshop as we look at how to leverage these two key technologies to achieve a consistent and reliable CD process.

Jenkins 2 supports multiple ways of working with and supporting Docker containers - as a Docker cloud node, as an agent running Docker, as a built-in environment, and as a tool that can be invoked separately. Using a combination of these approaches gives us flexibility and simplicity in building up a CD pipeline. Come learn about the different support models and available methods for creating and leveraging containers in Jenkins and get hands-on practice with the technology.
